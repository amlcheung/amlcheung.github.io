            <p class="ordinary-text-format"><span class="key-word-format">Hi there!</span> My name is Ashley Cheung and I am currently a candidate for 
                an M.S. in <span class="key-word-format">Computer Science</span> at Northeastern University’s Seattle Campus. 
                I am born and raised in the <span class="key-word-format">San Francisco Bay Area</span> and I moved to 
                <span class="key-word-format">Seattle</span> for graduate school. I  have really enjoyed living up here, as well as 
                exploring the city and the Pacific Northwest. In 2019, I graduated with a 
                B.S. in Microbiology from Cal Poly, SLO, which is located on California’s 
                beautiful <span class="key-word-format">central coast</span>. I have lots of hobbies, which include hiking, skiing, 
                nature photography, horseback riding, wine tasting, trying new 
                restaurants/cafes/bars and exploring small towns. I also love to spend time 
                with my cat, <span class="key-word-format">Gus</span>. He is very cute and loves to cuddle!
